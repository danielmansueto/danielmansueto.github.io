# Purpose & Features

This syringe pump was designed in DF-2100 as a low-cost, 3D-printed alternative to commercial laboratory pumps.  
It provides **precise, repeatable, and non-pulsatile flow** while remaining compatible with different syringe diameters (10 mLâ€“20 mL).  

**Features include:**
* Stepper motor + lead screw drive for accurate plunger motion  
* Arduino-controlled flow rate (mL/min) set via program variables  
* Compatibility with multiple syringe sizes without tools  
* LED indicators: green (running), yellow (paused), red (out of liquid)  
* Latching pushbutton for start/pause and a limit switch for plunger travel  
* Enclosure that integrates electronics and protects against spills  
* Unique branding and snap-fit/fastener assembly (no glue)

# Operation

1. **Insert syringe** into the holder and secure with the clamp.  
2. **Power on** using the external AC-DC supply.  
3. **Press the latching button** to start or pause the pump.  
4. The LED indicates status:  
   * Green = running  
   * Yellow = paused  
   * Red = empty (limit switch triggered)  
5. Flow rate is controlled in the Arduino sketch by adjusting the syringe diameter variable and the target flow rate (mL/min).  
6. To stop, press the button or disconnect power.  
7. Always ensure wiring and electronics remain dry and protected during use.
